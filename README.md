<h1>Python Notes</h1>
<p> Here you will see some important concepts of programming using python.<p>
  
<h2>Functions and Keywords</h2>

<p>Functions and keywords are the building blocks of a languageâ€™s syntax.
Functions are pieces of code that perform a unit of work.
Keywords are reserved words that are used to construct instructions. </p>
<p> Some of the keywords are: </p>

<h2>Operations</h2>
<p> a + b = Adds a and b <br>
a - b = Subtracts b from a <br>
a * b = Multiplies a and b <br>
a / b = Divides a by b <br>
a ** b = Elevates a to the power of b. For non integer values of b, this becomes a root (i.e. a**(1/2) is the square root of a) <br>
a // b = The integer part of the integer division of a by b <br>
a % b = The remainder part of the integer division of a by b </p>

<h2>Data Types</h2>
<p><b>Note:</b> Do not try to add different types data types together otherwise you would get error</p>
<p>For example: print(3 + "5")</p>

<h2>Variable</h2>
<p><b>Variables:</b> Names that we give to certain values in our programs.</p>
<p><b>Assignment:</b> The process of storing a value inside a variable.</p>
<p><b>Expression:</b> A combination of numbers, symbols, or other variables that produce a result when evaluated.</p>
