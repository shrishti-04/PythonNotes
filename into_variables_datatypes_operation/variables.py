# Variables: Names that we give to certain values in our programs.

# Example 1
length = 5
breadth = 4
ar = length * breadth

print("Therefore the area of the rectangle is " + str(ar))

# OUTPUT: Therefore the area of the rectangle is 20

# Example 2
base = 5
height = 3
area = 0.5*base*height

print(area)

# OUTPUT: 7.5

# Example 3
# for interchanging the values of variables like if a = 8 and b = 3 and for interchanching their values
a = 8
b = 3

s = a
a = b
b = s

print(a)
print(b)

# OUTPUT: a = 3; b = 8
